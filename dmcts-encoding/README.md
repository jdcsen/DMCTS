# dmcts-encoding

# TODO: Fill out once I've fully fleshed out what this library provides. As it stands, I plan on implementing:
* Datatypes and helper methods to communicate with dmcts-runtime instances.
* I/O wrappers to facilitate building the application-specific runtime required by dmcts-runtime
